This repository contains the problem sets and machine learning projects I contributed to as part of the assignments for Machine Learning and Data Mining (CS/CNS/EE 155) at the California Institute of Technology in the winter of 2025.

As per the Caltech honor code, if you are taking or planning on taking CS 155, please do not view these assignments prior to completing them.
